 * Total number of hash slots in a Redis/Valkey cluster.

 * Every key in a cluster is mapped to one of these 16,384 slots using CRC16(key) mod 16384.
 * This number was chosen because:
 * - It's a power of 2 (2^14) for efficient modulo operations
 * - Small enough for compact cluster metadata (2KB bitmap)
 * - Large enough for good key distribution across nodes
 *
